When chatting on WhatsApp with your friends, have you ever wanted to know -

  - the number of messages sent by each of you?
  - the words that you use the most?
  - most shared website links?
  - most used emojis and changes in emoji usage pattern with time?
  - your chatting time patterns - hourly, daily and monthly?
  - who texts first and the first text in each conversation?
  
I have! Therefore, I decided to put my recently acquired data analysis skills to use for finding these answers.
Whatsapp allows you to export any chat into a text file. I have written this code to read this chat file, parse it, analyse it and get the answers.
